%Abstract


In modern systems channel encoders and decoders are implemented as hardware modules for performance gain. They are essential parts of dependable communication systems. Firstly because signal propagation is disturbed by interferences and moving objects, and secondly because of the small transmission latencies required in real-time industrial control systems.

When using hash functions even a single bit flip leads to totally different results.

The communication is essential for the proper functionality of most systems. Every smallest peace of electronics is somehow connected to others and with the IoT era it will only grow in popularity. With todays technologies many connections can be performed without the use of any physical medium, like wires or fiber-optics. The wireless technologies are commonly used not only in cellular networks but more and more commonly in the short range communication and even industrial applications. An example is the problem of communicating systems placed on robotic arms that tend to move and rotate leading to fast deterioration of cables and plugs.
The goal of the ParSec project is to create a dependable, flexible and secure wireless communication system which meets all industrial automation requirements. It has to work with latencies below 1 ms and with very high noise level, serving many distributed clients at once. Moreover it has to deal with fading effects and potentially many reflections or even obstacles coming in the way of transmission and breaking it. The part of the work, that has been assigned to the Faculty of Technical Informatics at the Brandenurg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg was to cover the dependability of the wireless communication.
