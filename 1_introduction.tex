\chapter{Introduction and Motivation} \label{ch:int}

Wireless communication is more and more commonly used in highly unfavorable environments. Nowadays it's not only cellular communication, but also communication within cities, industrial production facilities and other short distance, real-time applications. Such systems have significant demand on low latencies and safety whilst being vastly exposed to signal interferences, multi-path signal propagation and fading effects. Also hardware modules residing in industrial environment experience higher 

In modern systems channel encoders and decoders are implemented as hardware modules for performance gain. They are essential parts of dependable communication systems. Firstly because signal propagation is disturbed by interferences and moving objects, and secondly because of the small transmission latencies required in real-time industrial control systems.

When using hash functions even a single bit flip leads to totally different results.
